				Coffee Bean is a simple Node / Angular application that allows front end developers to tune their skills with angular.js and general front end development. The idea with this app is to provide a back end API, which can be used to build a front end for it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Coffee is an important part of any developer's tool belt. We at Sonovate enjoy a nice cup of joe, and like to know about the coffee we drink. This application should allow us to view a list of our favourite coffee and then view details of each coffee.

			<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<p>
				Using the API as described below, we want you to build an <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">angular.js</a> <abbr title="Single Page Application">SPA</abbr> that will provide two views:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A list view - to display a list of all the coffee. There are only 5 coffees to view, so there is no need to think about pagination.</li>
				<li>A detail view - to display the details for a particular coffee</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Your application should make use of either angular's own routing mechanism or <a href="https://angular-ui.github.io/" target="_blank">bootstrap's UI framework</a>. You should provide reasons for your choice. You are completely free to install any number of bower components you need. If your are not familiar with bower, I recommend you take a look at the <a href="http://bower.io/" target="_blank">website</a>.
			</p>
			<p>For details on how to submit your work, please check the <a href="https://github.com/Sonovate/coffee_bean">GitHub Repository</a></p>

			<h2>The API</h2>
			<p>
				Below is a description of the API endpoints you can use in your angular application. All data for this application has been taken from <a href="http://pactcoffee.com" target="_new">Pact Coffee</a>
			</p>
			<table class="table table-bordered">
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Endpoint</th>
						<th>Description</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th scope="row">
							<code>GET /api/coffee</code>
						</th>
						<td>
							Lists all the coffee we like
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th scope="row">
							<code>GET /api/coffee/:slug</code>
						</th>
						<td>
							Gets the detail of the given coffee. For example, to get details for the Planalto coffee you would request:
							<code>GET /api/coffee/planalto</code>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<h3>The Model</h3>
			<p>Each coffee data item contains the following properties:</p>
			<table class="table table-bordered">
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Property Name</th>
						<th>Description</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th scope="row">name</th>
						<td>The name of the coffee</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th scope="row">slug</th>
						<td>The URL friendly identifier for the coffee. This is a unique value for each coffee.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th scope="row">flavour</th>
						<td>A brief description of the coffee's flavour</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th scope="row">description</th>
						<td>A description of how the coffee tastes.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th scope="row">country</th>
						<td>The country of origin</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th scope="row">producer</th>
						<td>The company / person who made the coffee</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<h3>Responses</h3>
			<p>The API provides data in JSON format. Each response will contain a <code>result</code> object which will contain the data requested.</p>
			<h5>Example</h5>
			<p>A request for the Planalto coffee would return a 200 OK response that looks like this:</p>
			<pre>
{
  "result": {
	"name": "Planalto",
	"slug": "planalto",
	"flavour": "Malt Milk Chocolate Shake",
	"description": "Rich chocolate and malt flavo...",
	"country": "Brazil",
	"producer": "Mariza Aparecida Franco Mantovanini and Sergio de Campos Mantovaninni"
  }
}
			</pre>
			<p>While a list request would return a result that contained an array:</p>
			<pre>
{
  "result": [
    {...},
    {...},
  ]
}
			</pre>
