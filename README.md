#Coffee Bean
A playground for front end developers

This application has been designed as a *getting started* exercise for Front End Developers at Sonovate. It also provides a chance for us to see how you approach a front end task, and what level your front end coding skills are at.

##This is not a test. 

I want to be clear, there is no pass or fail with this. You will be time-boxed, but if you cannot finish the task in the time allocated to you, that will **not** be considered a fail.

##Requirements

1. You will need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) `>=0.10.25` installed on your machine. There is no database for this application, so as long as you have node.js installed, you should be good to go.
1. Your favorite text editor / IDE.
 
##Getting started.
 
You will first need to fork this repository to your own GitHub account. See that *fork* button up there, top right? Click on it and choose your personal GitHub account. If you don't have your own account, you should sign up for one [here](https://github.com/join). Once forked, you will need to clone the repository.

To run the application, open a terminal / command prompt, change directory to the root of the repository and type:

```
> npm start
```

This should write *Server live at http://localhost:18513* to the terminal window. You should now be able to visit [http://localhost:18513] in your browser and see the app running. Make sure to read the [help page](http://localhost:18513/api) for details of the API.
